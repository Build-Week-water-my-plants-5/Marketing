                    <h3>Watering Frequency</h3>
                    <p>Houseplants should be watered about every 3 - 5 days. The amount that you'll water your houseplant depends on the size of the plant, but a good starting place for medium to small sized plants is 1/3 to 1/2 of a cup.</p>

                    <p>An overwatered houseplant will still have very damp soil between waterings. You may notice mold forming on the stem of the plant.</p>

                    <h3>How To Tell If Your Plant is Underwatered</h3>
                    <p>An underwatered house plant will have drooping leaves. If it is severely underwatered it may start to yellow. If leaves on your underwatered houseplant begin to die, you can prune them to allow the plant to focus its energy on the remaining healthy brush.</p>

                    <h3>Watering Frequency</h3>
                    <p>Succulents evolved in an environment where it rains rarely. Similarly, you should only water your succulent every 2 to 3 weeks, when you've noticed that the soil has completely dried out.</p>
